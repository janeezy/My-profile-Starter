				<h2>More About Me</h2>
				<p>
					The funny thing is that I spent over 13 years in Ukraine, which is
					half of my adult life, before I learned about front end development.
					Life there was great until February 24, 2022, when war broke out
					there.
					<br />
					I had to flee and leave everything I knew behind. It took me some time
					to start coming to terms with the situation because I lost so much
					during this time. <br />
					I kept looking for sales jobs in Schengen nations, but I was unable to
					locate any that paid more, I then turned to looking for other methods
					to boost my income, and after doing some study, I discovered that I
					could have been a developer much earlier.
					<br />
					While I was still trying to understand web development, I met an
					amazing person along the way who turned out to be my partner and who
					was also a senior software engineer.<br />
					I began my transition around the middle of the year 2022. During this
					time, I watched certified paid courses from udemy and a number of
					other sources, including MDN, and I also taught myself how to code. It
					wasn't simple at first, but finally I was able to finish web
					development since I kept reading and responding to so much stuff.

				<h2>More About Me</h2>
				<p>
					The funny thing is that I spent over 13 years in Ukraine, I have six
					years of sales management experience in the financial sector,
					including blockchain, banking, cryptocurrencies, digital marketing and
					areas of sales interest.
					<br />
					During this time, before I learned about front end development. Life
					there was great until February 24, 2022, when war broke out there.
					<br />
					I had to flee and leave everything I knew behind. It took me some time
					to start coming to terms with the situation because I lost so much
					during this time. <br />
					I kept looking for sales jobs in Schengen nations, but I was unable to
					locate any that paid more, I then turned to looking for other methods
					to boost my income, and after doing some study, I discovered that I
					could have been a developer much earlier.
					<br />
					While I was still trying to understand web development, I met an
					amazing person along the way who turned out to be my partner and who
					was also a senior software engineer.<br />

					I began my transition around the middle of the year 2022. During this
					time, I watched certified paid courses from udemy and a number of
					other sources, including MDN, and I also taught myself how to code. It
					wasn't simple at first, but finally I was able to finish web
					development, since I kept learning and coding. <br />

					I enjoy leveraging my skills of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with
					modern libraries and frameworks to build and manage responsive
					websites. <br />

					Dedicated to learning and professional development, eager to use
					skills on a larger development team, and eager to take on more
					challenging issues while continuing to look for ways to increase user
					effectiveness.
